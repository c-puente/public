			<h1 class="section-title">About Me</h1> 
			<p> I am a second-year student at Indiana University Bloomington pursuing majors in Economic Consulting and Business Analytics through the <a href="https://kelley.iu.edu/programs/undergrad/index.cshtml" target="_blank" class = "bio-links">Kelley School of Business</a>.
			I also intend on attaining a minor in Informatics through the <a href="https://sice.indiana.edu/" target="_blank" class = "bio-links">School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering</a>. This site was created and designed from scratch for my Informatics 101 course.
			Explore my site and you will find out more about my previous experiences and some of my past projects!</p>
			<br>	<!-- It really was coded from scratch in case you're checking ;)  -->
			<p>Some more about me personally: I am from Los Angeles, California, but I haven't always lived there. I was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico but later moved to Indiana. Then, California. Then, Florida. Then, California again.
			Now I go to school back again in Indiana, but I have grown up traveling internationally to visit my dad. He works abroad and every couple of years moves to a new country. Wherever he is, I visit him and we explore countries near him. 
			Currently, he lives in London, United Kingdom, so I have been fortunate enough to spend parts of my academic breaks in Europe. In total, I have visited 25 countries across four continents.</p>
