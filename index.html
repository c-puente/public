			<h1 class="section-title">About Me</h1> 
			<p> My educational background 
				(<a href="https://exploreprograms.indiana.edu/majors/economic-consulting" target="_blank" class = "bio-links">Economic Consulting</a>, 
				<a href="https://exploreprograms.indiana.edu/majors/business-analytics" target="_blank" class = "bio-links">Business Analytics</a>, 
				<a href="https://luddy.indianapolis.iu.edu/what-is-informatics/index.html" target="_blank" class = "bio-links">Informatics</a>) 
				gave me the space to explore my passion and curiosity for the intersections of business and technology. It also helped develop my analysis skills and experience with big data using Microsoft Excel, R, Stata, SQL, and Python through projects, course lab work, and case competitions.</p>

<p>At Google, I partnered with SMBs across the US to tailor product solutions to their growth goals as a product expert and internal resource. I worked with teams around the world to drive profitable investments, constantly reviewing costs, benchmarking, and calculating returns. </p>

<p>At Beyond Finance, I advanced financial analysis by building sophisticated models to optimize cash flow forecasting and KPI reporting, improving business operations and identifying strategic opportunities. My contributions have improved EBIT performance, streamlined processes, and supported data-driven decision-making at the executive level.</p>

<p>I aspire to leverage the analytics skills from my educational background along with my solutions-oriented experiences with businesses to improve operations, uncover unique insights, and lead impactful projects.</p>
 <p>This site was originally created and designed from scratch for my Informatics course. Explore my site and you will find out more about my previous experiences and some of my past projects!</p>
